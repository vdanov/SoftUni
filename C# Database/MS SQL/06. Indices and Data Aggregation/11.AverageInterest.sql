/*
Mr. Bodrog is highly interested in profitability.
He wants to know the average interest of all deposit groups split by whether the deposit has expired or not.
But that’s not all. He wants you to select deposits with start date after 01/01/1985.
Order the data descending by Deposit Group and ascending by Expiration Flag.
